# A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of 
# adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node 
# can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path 
# does not need to pass through the root.
# The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.
# Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any 
# non-empty path.
