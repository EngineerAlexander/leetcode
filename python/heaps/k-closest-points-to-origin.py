# Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] 
# represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k,
#  return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

# The distance between two points on the X-Y plane 
# is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).

# You may return the answer in any order. The answer is 
# guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

# Time complexity: O(n log n) for heapify and O(k log n) for k pops
# Space complexity: O(n) for the distances list
