# Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and 
# retrieving the minimum element in constant time.
# Implement the MinStack class:
# MinStack() initializes the stack object.
# void push(int val) pushes the element val onto the stack.
# void pop() removes the element on the top of the stack.
# int top() gets the top element of the stack.
# int getMin() retrieves the minimum element in the stack.
# You must implement a solution with O(1) time complexity for each function.
# Constraints:
# Methods pop, top and getMin operations will always be called on 
# non-empty stacks.

# Your MinStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MinStack()
# obj.push(val)
# obj.pop()
# param_3 = obj.top()
# param_4 = obj.getMin()

# Space complexity: O(n) where n is the number of elements in the stack
